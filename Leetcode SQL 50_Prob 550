#QUESTION

#Write a solution to report the fraction of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, rounded to 2 decimal places. 
#In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, 
  #then divide that number by the total number of players.


#MY CODE

WITH temp AS (
    SELECT player_id, MIN(event_date) AS first_login_date
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY player_id
)

SELECT ROUND(
    SUM(DATEDIFF(a.event_date, t.event_date) = 1) / COUNT(DISTINCT a.player_id), 2) 
    AS 'fraction'
FROM Activity a
JOIN  temp t 
ON a.player_id = t.player_id;


#NOTE

#fraction = (# logged AGAIN the NEXT DAY of first log in)
    #round to 2 dec
    #COUNT(SELECT player_id FROM Activity A1
        #JOIN Activity A2 
        #ON A1.player_id = A2.player_id 
        #WHERE A2.event_date = DATE_ADD(A1.event_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY))
    #FROM Activity
    #ROUND( ... , 2)

#select the MIN(event_date) -> create a table 'temp', to use it tgt
