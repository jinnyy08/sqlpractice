#Basic Joins
#1661. Average Time of Process per Machine


#QUESTION

#There is a factory website that has several machines each running the same number of processes. 
#Write a solution to find the average time each machine takes to complete a process.
#The time to complete a process is the 'end' timestamp minus the 'start' timestamp.
#The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.
#The resulting table should have the machine_id along with the average time as processing_time, which should be rounded to 3 decimal places.\
#Return the result table in any order.


#MY CODE

#using JOIN (joining self table)

SELECT A1.machine_id, ROUND(AVG(A2.timestamp - A1.timestamp), 3) AS 'processing_time'
FROM Activity A1
JOIN Activity A2
ON A1.machine_id = A2.machine_id AND A1.process_id = A2.process_id #Make sure all the other columns except Activity_type are SAME
WHERE A1.activity_type = 'start' AND A2.activity_type = 'end'
GROUP BY machine_id;
