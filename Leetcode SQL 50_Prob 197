#Basic Joins
#197. Rising Temperature

#QUESTION
#Write a solution to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).
#Return the result table in any order.


#MY CODE

#Method 1 - JOINING its own table (using DATE_ADD, for 1 day interval) 

SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2
ON w1.recordDate = DATE_ADD(w2.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY) #w2 is 1 day BEFORE
AND DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;


#Method 2 - Subquery (using DATE_SUB)

SELECT id
FROM Weather w1
WHERE w1.temperature > (SELECT temperature 
    FROM Weather w2 
    WHERE w2.recordDate = DATE_SUB(w1.recordDate, 1 INTERVAL DAY)
    ); #DATE_SUB - SUBTRACTING from w1 (today) to w2 (yesterday) 

#Method 3 - the most simplified, not involving addition or subtraction (using DATEDIFF, date DIFFERENCE as 1)

SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2
WHERE DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1 AND w1.temperature > w2.temperature;


#Note
#Compariting temperature, referring to PREVIOUS date -> use its OWN table and JOIN
#Date difference - use DATE_ADD, and refer to its own table
