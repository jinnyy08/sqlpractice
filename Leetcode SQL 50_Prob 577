#Basic Joins
#577 Employee Bonus

#QUESTION
#Write a solution to report the name and bonus amount of each employee with a bonus less than 1000.
#Return the result table in any order.


#MY CODE

SELECT E.name, B.bonus
FROM Employee E
LEFT JOIN Bonus B
ON E.empId = B.empId
WHERE B.bonus < 1000 OR B.bonus is NULL
GROUP BY E.empId;


#NOTE
#Use LEFT JOIN, as we focus onto the NAME - E table
#In the condition, also include the case of bonus being NULL
  #bonus lower than 1000 - possible to be NULL/empty => use Left Join
