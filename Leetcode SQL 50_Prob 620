#QUESTION

#Write a solution to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".
#Return the result table ordered by rating in descending order.


#MY CODE

SELECT *
From Cinema
WHERE MOD(ID, 2) = 1 #condition 1 - ODD-numbered id 
    AND description <> "boring" #condition2 - NOT "boring"
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY rating DESC;


#NOTE

#be specific onto each conditions
#condition 1 - ODD-numbered id

    # Using MOD(variable, dividing no.) = remainder 
#condition2 - description NOT being "boring"
  # -> use <> for NOT EQUAL
