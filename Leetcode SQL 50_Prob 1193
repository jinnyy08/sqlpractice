#QUESITON

#Write an SQL query to find for each month and country, the number of transactions and their total amount, the number of approved transactions and their total amount.
#Return the result table in any order.


#MY CODE
SELECT SUBSTR(trans_date, 1, 7) AS 'month' , country, COUNT(id) AS 'trans_count', SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS 'approved_count', SUM(amount) AS 'trans_total_amount', SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS 'approved_total_amount'
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY 1, 2



#NOTE

#month
    # SUBSTR(trans_date, 1, 7)
    # we only need the year and month -> cut the date to the point we only need -> use SUBSTR()

#trans_count
    # COUNT(id) - for each id 

#trans_total_amount
    # SUM(amount)

#approved_count
    # SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
    # AS 'approved_count'

#trans_total_amount
    # SUM(amount)
    # as 'trans_total_amount'

#approved_total_amount
    #SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) 

#for EACH month and country
  # -> GROUP BY month, country
