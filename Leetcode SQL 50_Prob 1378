#Basic JOINs
#Replace Employee ID With The Unique Identifier

#Write a solution to show the unique ID of each user, If a user does not have a unique ID replace just show null.
#Return the result table in any order.

#My Code

SELECT unique_id, name
From Employees E
LEFT JOIN EmployeeUNI U
ON E.id = U.id;


#Notes
#USAGE OF *LEFT JOIN* - to indicate the 'NULL' if there is no overlap in the unique_id
