#Basic Joins
#570 Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports


#QUESTION

#Write a solution to find managers with at least five direct reports.
#Return the result table in any order.


#MY CODE

SELECT E1.name
FROM Employee E1
JOIN Employee E2
ON E1.id = E2.managerId
GROUP BY E2.managerId
HAVING COUNT(E2.managerId) >= 5;


#NOTE
#AT LEAST 5 direct reports -> use COUNT(managerId)
#JOIN its own table -> ON id AND manager_id
#GROUP BY managerId -> additional condition, that its count is >= 5
