#Basic Aggregate
#1174 Immediate Food Delivery II

#QUESTION

#If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called immediate; otherwise, it is called scheduled.
#The first order of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

#Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, rounded to 2 decimal places.


#MY CODE

SELECT ROUND( AVG(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) * 100, 2) AS 'immediate_percentage'
From Delivery
WHERE (customer_id, order_date) IN (
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date)
    FROM Delivery
    GROUP BY customer_id)


#NOTE

#immediate
    # order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date (1)
    # if NOT -> scheduled (0)

# CASE WHEN order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
    # sum of this = # of IMMEDIATE
    # TOTAL = SUM(*)



#TO REMEMBER

#percent = AVG * 100
    # AVG(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) * 100

#ascending order -> no need indication

#IMMEDIATE, from the order_date should be EARLIEST => form new table having EARLIEST
  #Use FROM, and write new table 

#method (sum / count)
    #SUM(CASE WHEN order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)/ COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) * 100

#method (avg)
    # AVG(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date) * 100
