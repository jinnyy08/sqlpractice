#1633. Percentage of Users Attended a Contest

#Write a solution to find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to two decimals.
#Return the result table ordered by percentage in descending order. In case of a tie, order it by contest_id in ascending order.


#My Work

SELECT contest_id, ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) * 100 / (SELECT COUNT(user_id) FROM Users), 2) as percentage
FROM Register
GROUP BY contest_id 
ORDER BY percentage DESC, contest_id;




# NOTES

#NEED TO USE SUB-QUERY

# % of users REGISTERED in each CONTEST = (no. DISCTINCT part. users) / (TOTAL no. part. users)
  # no. DISCTINCT part. users = COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)
  # TOTAL no. part. users = SELECT COUNT(user_id) FROM Users -- using SUB-Query
    #OR SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM Register
   
# => % of REGISTERED users = (no. DISCTINCT part. users) * 100 / (TOTAL no. part. users)
# => 'percentage' into 2 dec => ROUND((COUNT DISTINCT user_id) * 100 / (SELECT COUNT(user_id) FROM Users), 2) AS 'percentage'
